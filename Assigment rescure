      Several bridges named London Bridge have spanned the River Thames between the City of London and Southwark, in central London. 
      The current crossing, which opened to traffic in 1973, is a box girder bridge built from concrete and steel. 
      It replaced a 19th-century stone-arched bridge, which in turn superseded a 600-year-old stone-built medieval structure. 
      This was preceded by a succession of timber bridges, the first of which was built by the Roman founders of London.

            Roman bridges, built by ancient Romans, were the first large and lasting bridges built. 
            Roman bridges were built with stone and had the arch as the basic structure. 
            Most utilized concrete as well, which the Romans were the first to use for bridges.

      The current bridge stands at the western end of the Pool of London and is positioned 30 metres (98 ft) upstream from previous alignments. 
      The approaches to the medieval bridge were marked by the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr on the northern bank and by Southwark Cathedral on the southern shore. 
      Until Putney Bridge opened in 1729, London Bridge was the only road-crossing of the Thames downstream of Kingston upon Thames. 
      London Bridge has been depicted in its several forms, in art, literature, and songs, including the nursery rhyme "London Bridge Is Falling Down".

            Medieval London Bridge is a thing of legend.
            For centuries it was the only crossing point for the Thames that didn't involve stepping into a boat, but it wasn't necessarily the safest option. 
            Here are some of the dangers that could befall someone travelling between Southwark and the City both on and under the bridge, between its construction in 1209 and eventual replacement in 1831.

      The modern bridge is owned and maintained by Bridge House Estates, an independent charity of medieval origin overseen by the City of London Corporation. 
      It carries the A3 road, which is maintained by the Greater London Authority. The crossing also delineates an area along the southern bank of the River Thames, 
      between London Bridge and Tower Bridge, that has been designated as a business improvement district.

            Big Ben is the nickname for the Great Bell of the striking clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster in London and is usually extended to refer to both the clock and the clock tower.
            The official name of the tower in which Big Ben is located was originally the Clock Tower, but it was renamed Elizabeth Tower in 2012 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.
